# C# Methods and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains C# console application tasks focusing on methods, loops, arrays, strings,
and basic algorithmic problem solving. Each task is separated using `#region` blocks in the code
for clarity.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1 – Count Even and Odd Numbers
- Counts even and odd numbers in an array
- Uses loops and conditional statements

### Task 2 – Palindrome Check
- Checks whether a string is a palindrome
- Uses string indexing and while loop

### Task 3 – Ascending Order Check
- Verifies if three numbers are in increasing order
- Returns boolean result

### Task 4 – Reverse a String
- Reverses a given string manually
- Demonstrates string traversal logic

### Task 5 – Sum of Digits
- Calculates sum of digits of an integer
- Handles negative numbers

### Task 6 – Login Simulation
- Simple username/password check
- Limits attempts using loops

### Task 7 – Divisibility Check (3 and 5)
- Checks if a number is divisible by 3, 5, or both
- Prints corresponding messages

### Task 8 – Compare Digit Sums
- Compares digit sums of two numbers
- Prints the number with the larger digit sum

### Task 9 – Sum of Even Numbers in a Range
- Calculates sum of even numbers between two values
- Handles reversed ranges

### Task 10 – Triangle Type Detection
- Determines triangle type (equilateral, isosceles, scalene)
- Validates triangle inequality

## Concepts Practiced
- Methods
- Loops (for, while)
- Conditional statements
- Arrays
- Strings
- Algorithmic thinking

## Technologies
- C#
- .NET Console Application

## Purpose
This repository helps strengthen logical thinking and problem-solving skills
while practicing core C# programming fundamentals.
